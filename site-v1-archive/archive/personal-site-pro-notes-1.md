# Goals

The goal of the site is to facilitate a job offer, ideally one in which I can design and work with layouts and create templates for layouts -- but at this juncture any entry-level job works.

Demonstrate my proficiency in the most important elements of web development, layouts, and visual design.

The viewer should not have to guess at the purpose of the page -- or about anything on the page.

- HTML (the content of a webpage)
- CSS (how the webpage will look)
- Scripting languages (scripting, conditional statements, connecting web pages)
- Layout design

## Home

 - An immediate feeling of visual balance, following by a feeling of relaxation and quiet stability
 - Designed in such a way that a recruiter will be immediately intrigued and will want to have a conversation. The site needs to immediately reflect my understanding of CSS and layout principles.

- A dark mode in place -->
