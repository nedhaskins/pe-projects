# Case study outline

Each student in the Design for the Web course recently completed a week-long "Responsive Theme Challenge".

This project tied together many elements we'd been studying in the course up to this point:

- HTML structure; the "hierarchy" of elements;

- CSS - work with responsive elements, section spacing, color choices, typography, and making a "unified whole" or "unified statement"

- PHP; creating associative arrays and pulling the data to be used for dynamic content (section) creation

We first wrote out all of the code needed to recreate a sample responsive layout as accurately as possible.

We then each chose an industry or "niche" to research. The idea was to gather in one place as many visual tricks and layout elements that were common to all of the sites researched.  What colors / color schemes were favored the most? Font pairings? How was spacing used throughout the site?  Was there enough between the elements, or were things packed too closely together, like sardines?


# Recreate the HTML and structural CSS

The first day of the project, all of the students were given the same "skeleton layout" over which we would apply design choices with CSS later.  Main themes of this phase included the responsiveness of the site, 


# Think of the CSS garden

The initial constraints placed on us were to ONLY change the CSS in the code.  Look at the design choices and emulate as specifically as possible.

# Research an industry and gauge style

What's the best way to do research?  Being able to answer that question went hand-in-hand with this step.

My initial thought process for the research went something like this:  Treat it like a spree (or a sprint). I chose half a dozen websites and grabbed everything I could off of them as quickly as I could.

I began by looking up rental agency websites in a familiar location - the Outer Banks of North Carolina, a popular resort area in the Midatlantic region.

I took note of the colors used -- shades of green and blue took center stage on nearly every page, followed by tan and white.  It fit the sites' goal of evoking a "beach" vibe.

Beach landscapes were used as a backdrop for header text on every site I visited. Some websites immediately showed a date/time/number of guests component right off the bat ("Choose your destination"); users were able to cut down on their browsing time by being given back only the available results within their specified time period.

For all of the sites, further down, a module showed "categories" of rentals to choose from ("Oceanside Rentals", "Last Minute Deals", etc).

# Style tile

Wanted to include color and font elements.  Include fonts used for headings and regular text.  Made a palette of colors found on the various sites.  Showed a potential "card" for a rental house and all of the elements it might include.  Was less concerned about putting it in "layout" format at this stage then getting a real feel for the "vibe" of the site and what it's selling or promoting.


# Steps to building the site - round one

- Only add fonts and colors

- Get feedback on initial appearance and next steps

# Round two - applying feedback

- Really addressed spacing issues in this round; added the "vw" element to help get consistent spacing for some elements.  Reorganized the code so items specific to a certain "type" of module were included in the generic "module" stylesheet, while singular changes to element colors were put in the "site.css" file.  Font choices for the entire page were put in the typography area.


# Round three - "last 10%" - final changes

- Sharpened up spacing

- Changed the font used for headings based on user (student) feedback.

- Made all elements in dark mode consistent


# Conclusion

The biggest takeaways from this project were figuring out the right places to do layout elements and understanding the reasons for it.  Learned a great deal about code organization from this project.  Later, I received feedback about visualizing and working with a grid layout from the start, among other things, and I'm looking forward to implementing these suggestions in my next project.
