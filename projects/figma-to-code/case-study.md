Figma-to-code


This project is an exercise in rendering out Figma mockups into workable site code.



Preparation




The initial materials given to use fell into one of four asset categories:

UI kits - all of the available modules to be used in each of the three mockups.
Components - all of the granular elements needed to compose the modules.
Icon - Available icons
Templates - the final three mockups, to be rendered out in code


Initial steps
the first considerations:
Whatâ€™s reusable.  If time is a factor, the goal is to write code that is reusable.  That means creating a filesystem that allows for easily accessible reusable components.


how many of these components are reusable?  how many are just variations of one component?




How to organize the files?




Hashing out the details.
