{"route63cda135d4d4c":{"type":"interstate","number":"85","name":"Interstate 85","length":"67","startLocation":"67","endLocation":"67","description":"Interstate 85 (I-85) is a major Interstate Highway in the Southeastern United States. Its southern terminus is at an interchange with I-65 in Montgomery, Alabama; its northern terminus is an interchange with I-95 in Petersburg, Virginia, near Richmond. It is nominally north\u2013south as it carries an odd number, but it is physically oriented northeast\u2013southwest and covers a larger east-west span than north-south. While most Interstates that end in a \"5\" are cross-country, I-85 is primarily a regional route serving five southeastern states: Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.","image":"images\/I-85.svg"},"route63cda5767f240":{"type":"state-route","number":"522","name":"State Route 522","length":"344","startLocation":"West VIrginia","endLocation":"update","description":"Powhatan --> WV","image":"images\/US-522.svg"},"route63cf41a8c99a7":{"type":"state-route","number":"208","name":"State Route 208","length":"85","startLocation":"Ferncliff","endLocation":"Fredericksburg","description":"yokel","image":"images\/VA-208.svg"}}
