# Goal of the Site

The goal of the site is to facilitate the creation of a self-propagating busines lifecycle.  Clients come to the site, hire us, and refer us to others that then become clients.  Ultimately the goal is to generate leads purely on referrals.

All elements of the site should work together to create an aesthetically pleasing experience that taps into the visitor's subconscious desire to attain and retain the best.

Tools in the toolkit:

- HTML (the content of a webpage)
- CSS (how the webpage will look)
- Scripting languages (PHP, JavaScript): scripting, conditional statements, connecting web pages, animations
