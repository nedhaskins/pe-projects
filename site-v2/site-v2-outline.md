# Goal of the Site

The goal of the site is to facilitate an entry-level job offer.

It will demonstrate a high level of proficiency in the most important elements of web development, layouts, and visual design.

The viewer should not have to guess at the purpose of the page -- or about anything on the page.

- HTML (the content of a webpage)
- CSS (how the webpage will look)
- Scripting languages (scripting, conditional statements, connecting web pages)
- Layout design

## Home

 An immediate feeling of visual balance, following by a feeling of relaxation and quiet stability
 
 Designed in such a way that a recruiter will be immediately intrigued and will want to have a conversation. The site needs to immediately reflect my understanding of CSS and layout principles.
