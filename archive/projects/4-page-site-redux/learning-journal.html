		<h1>Learning Journal</h1>

		<p>I feel positive about the class overall so far.  I appreciate that we spent the first 2 weeks talking about the nature of developers' work, the human mind and what comes easily / not so easily to it, how computers work conceptually, and time management.  I like that we're encouraged to bring in our own experiences on a daily basis into the class (i.e. visual inspiration ideas, good and bad).</p>


		<p>The biggest challenge so far is catching up with classmates in real time.  I want to do my best to remedy this in the coming weeks.  We can definitely comment and leave feedback on each other's work, but I want to get more practice really being "in the moment" and relating ideas to people as they come up -- sometimes "off the cuff" ideas can be difficult to capture later.</p>

		<p>I'm going to read up on how to make many spaces in a row appear in the text on a website -- right now the website seems to interpret 100 spaces the same way it interprets 1 space.</p>
