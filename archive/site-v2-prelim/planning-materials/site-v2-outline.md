# Goal of the Site

The goal of the site is to facilitate an entry-level job offer.

It will demonstrate a high level of proficiency in the most important elements of web development, layouts, and visual design.

The viewer should not have to guess at the purpose of the page -- or about anything on the page.

- HTML (the content of a webpage)
- CSS (how the webpage will look)
- Scripting languages (scripting, conditional statements, connecting web pages)
- Layout design

## Home

 An immediate feeling of visual balance, following by a feeling of relaxation and quiet stability
 
 Designed in such a way that a recruiter will be immediately intrigued and will want to have a conversation. The site needs to immediately reflect my understanding of CSS and layout principles.

- ## The Lab

	Here's my experimental area -- projects in progress, ideas I'm working on, exercises I'm doing to sharpen my skills.

	- ### Codepens

	This site allows for the creation of quick layouts based on HTML, CSS and Javascript with real-time updates.

	- ### Github

	Repositories of past and present projects.

	- ### E4P
		- Explain the purpose of the exercises
			- Exercise detail link - explain how the form works, what you had to do with the code to make it work the way it needed to 

	- ### Layout Garden

	These layouts are an exploration of the capabilities of CSS.  Some of these were prompts given to us in the Design for the Web course; others I found through my research and I replicated them for practice and to learn some new properties.

	- Purpose of the site.  Why are you doing these layouts?  To explore as many different types of layouts and CSS properties as possible and to use them in concert to make a harmonious endpiece that can serve as a template for future projects.

	- Link to layout detail page (component)

	- Layout detail page: #4
		- Text: This layout stood out to me for its use of relative/absolute positioning. I recreated the box transformation on this page by using the CSS transform:translate prperty.
			- Relative / absolute positioning?

			- Case study?
				- Title / subtitle; goal

- ## Style Guide

	- Details all of the style elements used on the site

- ## Contact

	- Header - let's get started on a project!!
	- Form with client / recruiter / employer's name, email, and a detailed description of why they want to talk to me and what they're currently looking for.  Need a way to distinguish between the different types of people who might reach out - maybe a radio button specifying what type of person they are?  Developer / Recruiter / Employer / Person who just wants to talk.


## **Notes on site styles**

For page changes (when a link is clicked), have a horizontal mask at an angle?
