				<h1>I'm a web designer, musician,<br> and&nbsp;SVG enthusiast.</h1>

				<p>I've been a cellist since I was 10. My Virginia-based booking agency, Ninja Strings, provides live music for public and private events across the Eastern Seaboard.</p>

				<p>I began studying Python and SQL in the fall of 2019; after two years of study I had built a foundational knowledge base in database design, architecture, and implementation and gained experience with Apache Airflow and various applications within Amazon Web Services.  I obtained an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification in July 2021.</p>

				<p>I enrolled in Perpetual Education's Design for the Web course in February 2022 and am currently focusing on front-end development.</p>

				<p>Through Affinity Designer, I've rediscovered my passion for visual design. I love optimizing code and learning about the intricacies of SVGs!</p>
