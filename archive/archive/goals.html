		<h2>March 25, 2022</h2>

		<p>Earlier in the class, I outlined some goals / endpoints to focus on as I exercise and build on my skill sets gradually, day by day.</p>

		<p>They’ve evolved a little bit since I last put my ideas on paper.</p>

		<p>So here they are. <em>Disclaimer: these are based on my current vantage point — not the one I’ll have a few months from now!  Goal times are my current perception of how long it will take to get to a “baseline” competency level.</em></p>


		<p>I have loved (emphasize: LOVED) typefaces  and fonts my entire life and love browsing fonts, seeing what’s appealing, and picking just the right one for the right purpose.  A typeface can make or break a website, a project idea, a final visual design…etc. I feel that with much more knowledge in this area, I could develop a really strong sense of what works font-wise for websites / fonts that complement certain visual designs well and do consulting work in this area.  To this end, I will start to do as much reading as possible here and build my knowledge of typefaces gradually, and apply as many new ones as I can in upcoming projects. (Can start immediately…goal endpoint - at least 3 years) <em>At the current juncture, this is my ideal job and the best possible scenario. I recognize that I have far more technical knowledge to acquire here and love the idea of digging in and learning it all.</em></p>

		<p>	•	My strength in visual design lies in abstract shapes and a strong color sense — matching colors together and choosing colors to convey a certain “vibe” or mood.  I want to increase my technical skill in this area to create expressive shapes and create strong color palettes that can be used as themes for websites.  (Goal endpoint - at least 2 years) </p>

		<p>	•	I am seeing myself succeed as a UX developer / consultant.  Improving the user experience through optimizing code / visual design elements / typefaces is something I love doing already, and I think I could get clients excited about hiring me for this work. (Goal endpoint - between a year and 2 years) </p>
		<p>	•	Long-term goal:  Build a strong client network.  This will be done by taking on pro bono projects right now.  My personal business website and a site for my friend’s woodworking business are the first two on the docket.  The next step will be to step out locally (to me that means Richmond, VA) and reach out to friends and acquaintances and let them know what I’m doing.  (Goal endpoint: neverending)</p>

		<p>These are the starting points, and I will track the progress of each as I go.</p>
