I obtained an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification in July 2021.</p><p>I enrolled in Perpetual Education's Design for the Web course in February 2022 and am currently focusing on front-end development. Through Affinity Designer, I've rediscovered my passion for visual design. I love optimizing code and have recently gotten pretty hooked on the Wordpress framework and building out custom frameworks of my own.</p>"
