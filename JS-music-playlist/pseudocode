userInputs = {
	"genre": "",
	"decade": "",
	"speed": ""
}



//button on the genre page
genreSubmitButton = takes user input and pushes it to the above variable




//button on the decade page
decadeSubmitButton = takes user input and pushes it to the above variable


//button on the speed page
speedSubmitButton = takes user input and pushes it to the above variable...and also directs the user to the page with the final setlist



//on the backend...there needs to be logic to do the following:

--find 10 songs at random that contain values that match the criteria that the user's chosen

--there needs to be logic to make that correlation between key-values in the database and key-values in the empty variable (object) that the user's filling up



//finally...



the setlist page will return each key-value pair from the above object, formatted for readability
